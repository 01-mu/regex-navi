# UI Style

## Visual Direction
- Base style: Neo-brutalism.
- Priorities: high contrast, bold structure, and clarity over polish.

## Color & Typography
- Use crisp backgrounds with hard-edged panels and thick borders.
- Prefer strong accent colors (e.g., vivid orange, cobalt, lime) against neutral bases.
- Typography should be sturdy and readable for Japanese text; combine a clean sans-serif with a mono font for regex.

## Components
- Panels: solid fills, 2-4px borders, and hard drop shadows (no blur-heavy glass).
- Buttons: chunky, high-contrast, with hover states that shift border and fill.
- Inputs: monospace for regex text; visible focus ring and error state.

## Motion
- Keep motion minimal and functional: small entrance reveal for the diagram and hover feedback only.

## Accessibility
- Maintain readable contrast ratios, especially for Japanese text.
- Ensure the diagram scales and stays scrollable on small screens.
